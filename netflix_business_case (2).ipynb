        "4. Try to colab with the popular actors with the popular directors since actors would have huge fan base and would attract wide range of users and directors with most tvshows/movies would have lot of experience and innovative ideas.\n",
        "5. Take a look at the data above and try to release the contents in those weeks or months, since it it the time when most of the tvshows and movies are released users would be exploring something new to watch during those days.\n",
        "6. maintain a time gap: keep in mind to have some gap between the released date and the date added. This would be a huge turning point. it should not be  too late that the users forget about the tv shows or movies and not to fast that it would not build any excitment among the userr.\n",
        "7. We see that the u.s is the country with the most movies/tvshows it is recomended to lean more towards us users but  not forget about the other users since there are other millions of global users.\n",

        "* make sure that any contents are not offensive to any users of any country\n",
        "8. Durtion :keep in mind while producing a movie not to produce movies with long duration.For something to watch with loner duration people would usaaly watch tv shows series , so while prodcing a movies try to keep it short.\n",
        "8. Should avoid producing cotents that are not really popular: since netflix is a popular platform for tvshows/movies users would have huge expectations\n",
        "so, it is reccomended to avoid movies/tvshows with list ratings , the genre which is list produced.\n",
